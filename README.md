# nanosatellite-power-estimation

This repository contains the source code, simulation data, and documentation for the article:

**Development and Simulation of Orbital‐Model‐Based Algorithms for 1U Nanosatellite Power Estimation**, submitted to *Advances in Space Research*.

## Description

The project focuses on the development and simulation of five orbital-model-based algorithms to estimate electrical power generation in 1U CubeSats in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The models consider orbital position, solar vector, solar radiation, temperature, sunlight and eclipse time duration, and the small satellite configuration to determine the electrical power generated from solar panel arrays.

## Contents

- `/code/`: Python scripts for power estimation algorithms.
- `/data/`: Sample input parameters and simulation output files.
- `/figures/`: Plots generated from simulation results (optional).
- `/docs/`: Supporting documentation for reproducibility.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
